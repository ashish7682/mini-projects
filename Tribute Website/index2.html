        <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2><br>
           <p> <b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR</b> is (15 October 1931 â€“
            27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
            served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born
            and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
            aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist
            and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
